## TSL Docs

This project is a documentation site for **TSL (Three Shader Language)**, a shader node system in `three.js`. It uses **Renoun** to ingest the TSL source tree, produce structured metadata, and render that structured data as a browsable docs experience.

Content is generated from the TSL codebase rather than from hand-written markdown, so the docs can stay closely aligned with the actual implementation.
